This information is used when identifying what Transactions should be considered for the Budget Screen and how Accounts are grouped in dropdowns elsewhere on the site.\n\nThe Initial Balance and Initial Balance Date fields are used to set a started balance in K9 Koinz, thus letting you skip entering in years worth of transactional data.  You are able to update these fields at any time if you need to reconcile your balance.\n\nThe Minimum Balance field is used to show you Minimum Balance alerts and warnings on the site's homepage."

If you Current Balance is above your Minimum Balance, but within 10% of it, you will get a Minimum Balance Warning message to indicate you are getting close to your Minimum Balance."
